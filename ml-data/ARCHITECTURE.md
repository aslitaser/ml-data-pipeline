# ML Data Pipeline Architecture

This document describes the high-level architecture of the ML Data Pipeline framework.

## Design Principles

The ML Data Pipeline is designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Memory Efficiency**: Zero-copy operations, smart buffer management, and minimizing allocations
- **Clear Ownership Boundaries**: Explicit transfer of data ownership to avoid implicit copying
- **Modularity**: Well-defined interfaces for easy extension
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive type system for machine learning data with minimal runtime overhead
- **Performance**: Optimized for high throughput with adaptive resource management

## Core Components

### Data Flow Architecture

The primary data flow follows this pattern:

```
Source → Batching Buffer → Transform Workers → Output Buffer → Sink
```

With backpressure mechanisms at each stage:

1. **Source Output Buffer**: Size limited by configuration
2. **Transform Workers Input Queue**: Size adjusted dynamically based on memory budget
3. **Transform Output Buffer**: Collects processed results from parallel workers
4. **Sink Input Buffer**: Final buffer before persistence

### Components Breakdown

#### Sources

Sources are responsible for reading data from external systems like:

- File formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON)
- Databases and data warehouses
- Streaming systems
- In-memory datasets

Sources implement the `Source` trait:

```rust
pub trait Source: Send + Sync {
    type Item;
    type Error;
    
    fn next_batch(&mut self, max_batch_size: usize) -> Result<Option<Vec<Self::Item>>, Self::Error>;
    fn size_hint(&self) -> Option<usize> { None }
    fn memory_usage(&self) -> usize;
}
```

#### Transformations

Transformations apply operations to data batches:

- Feature engineering operations
- Data cleaning and validation
- Encoding and normalization
- Augmentation and generation

Transformations implement the `Transform` trait:

```rust
pub trait Transform: Send + Sync {
    type Input;
    type Output;
    type Error;
    
    fn transform(&mut self, items: Vec<Self::Input>) -> Result<Vec<Self::Output>, Self::Error>;
    fn memory_usage(&self) -> usize;
    fn reset(&mut self) { }
}
```

#### Sinks

Sinks output the transformed data to:

- Files or storage systems
- Machine learning training frameworks
- Databases or data warehouses
- In-memory storage for direct access

Sinks implement the `Sink` trait:

```rust
pub trait Sink: Send + Sync {
    type Item;
    type Error;
    
    fn consume(&mut self, items: Vec<Self::Item>) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
    fn flush(&mut self) -> Result<(), Self::Error>;
    fn memory_usage(&self) -> usize;
}
```

#### Pipeline Orchestration

The `Pipeline` struct orchestrates the flow of data through the system:

- Manages data transfer between components
- Implements backpressure mechanisms
- Monitors memory usage and performance
- Handles parallelism and concurrency

```rust
pub struct Pipeline<S, T, K> 
where 
    S: Source,
    T: Transform<Input = S::Item>,
    K: Sink<Item = T::Output>
{
    source: S,
    transform: T,
    sink: K,
    budget: Arc<MemoryBudget>,
    config: PipelineConfig,
}
```

### Memory Management

The memory management subsystem includes:

1. **Memory Budget**: Global constraint on memory usage with allocation tracking
2. **Buffer Pool**: Reuse of common-sized buffers to reduce allocation overhead
3. **Zero-Copy Views**: Slicing of data without copying through reference counting
4. **Memory Mapping**: Using virtual memory for large datasets
5. **Memory Pressure Handler**: Adaptive response to system memory constraints

### Type System

The ML data type system provides:

1. **Core Types**: Primitive numeric types, strings, binary data
2. **ML-Specific Types**: Tensors, embeddings, and sparse structures
3. **Compound Types**: Lists, maps, structs
4. **Memory Layout Control**: Columnar and row-based formats
5. **Arrow Integration**: Seamless conversion to/from Arrow format

## Threading Model

The framework's threading model consists of:

1. **Control Thread**: Manages pipeline lifecycle and monitors performance
2. **Source Thread**: Reads from data source with backpressure awareness
3. **Worker Thread Pool**: Processes batches in parallel with shared memory budget
4. **Sink Thread**: Consumes processed results and handles persistence

## Extension Points

### Plugin System

The plugin architecture allows extending the system with:

- Custom sources for new data formats or systems
- Specialized transformations for domain-specific processing
- Custom sinks for integration with ML frameworks
- Custom algorithms for optimized processing

### Monitoring and Metrics

The monitoring system provides:

- Memory usage tracking
- Throughput and latency measurements
- Backpressure and bottleneck detection
- Integration with external monitoring systems

## Performance Considerations

### Vectorization

- SIMD-optimized operations for numeric processing
- Batch processing for amortized overhead
- Columnar format for cache-friendly memory access

### I/O Optimization

- Memory mapping for large files
- Asynchronous I/O for overlapping computation and I/O
- Buffered reading with prefetch
- Compression aware processing

### Parallelism

- Adaptive thread pool sizing based on workload
- Work stealing for load balancing
- Pipeline parallel execution
- Data parallel processing
